# multiple-disease-prediction

The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson’s disease through a single integrated platform. The project utilizes pre-trained models stored as .sav files, which are loaded into a Python web application (typically using Streamlit or Flask) for real-time prediction. Users can input relevant health parameters like age, blood pressure, glucose level, or other medical data through an interactive interface, and the system provides instant results indicating the probability or presence of a particular disease. Each disease has its own trained model — for example, logistic regression or random forest for diabetes and heart disease, and SVM for Parkinson’s — built using publicly available datasets. The application emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and efficiency, allowing multiple models to be accessed from a single app. This project demonstrates how machine learning can support early disease detection and assist users in understanding health risks without requiring extensive medical expertise.
